# What is update 1.1?
- Login bugfixes:
- You can't log in to loggingin user
- When there is an error, you can't log in after clicking any key
- New login feature: you can be Guest (delete all users in .Commands/Users in your home directory)
## Why there is no download link to update 1.0?
Sadly, but I added version saving when version 1.1 of Commands is released.
